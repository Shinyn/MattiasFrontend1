### Simpler:

- Takes info, sorts it into groups and displays it on a webpage.

### This program exist as:

1. A personal learning tool for coding
2. A way to sort and print out information from JSON objects.
3. The examining assignment for the frontend 1 course.

---

### Who could benefit from this:

1. Teachers / coaches who need to sort students into groups
2. Companies that want to organize JSON data

---

## Technical documentation:

**Summary:**

- A program that prints out JSON files organized into separate groups chosen from a dropdown menu

### If you want to use the code:

- To access the JSON object use the **"getJsonInfo()"** function which takes in a value from the dropdown menu
- To access the form element use the **"form"** variable
- To access the "Rensa" button use the **"clear"** variable
- To access the ul element use the **"list"** variable
- Accessing variables that are **inside** the JSON object **outside** of the **"getJsonInfo()"** function can be done using  
  fetch() on the **http://localhost:3000/api/users/** address and destructure it as i have done in the **"getJsonInfo()"** function
- To clear the list of li tags use the **"clearList()"** function
- To clear all arrays use the **"resetGroups()"** function
- To sort **NAMES** alphabetically use the **"sortNameAlphabetically()"** which accepts an array as argument
- To sort by number use the **"sortByNumber()"** function (**_this isn't working 100% as intended_**)
- To print out groups to the page use the **showGroups()** function - it appends a "li" element to the "ul" element
- The handleForm() function prevents the form from resetting the webpage and calls the **clearList()** and **getJsonInfo()** functions
- The **fillUlWith()** is part of what makes the **showGroups()** and **sortNameAlphabetically()** functions tick

#### If you want to use the functions that have been commented out (removed) you can uncomment them, play around with them a bit and maybe (undoubtedly) improve my code.

#### Some of the functionality that exists but isn't in use is:

- An error message for when a JSON parameter cant be sorted
- Parameters for zodiac sign, positiveExperience, explanation, discord, github, skills, birthYear and hash code
- Zodiac sign also have the following sub-categories that can be used: name, element, stone, symbol, dateMin, dateMax
- The html file also has commented out code that needs to be uncommented for use, the ones that exist are: discord, github, skills, hash, birthYear

## Known Bugs:

1. Clicking the "VÃ¤lj Parameter" button more than once will multiply the elements in the list by amount of clicks
2. Clicking "Visa Grupp" twice will clear the list of elements

- It's a little funny that the first problem can be solved with the second problem ðŸ˜…

## Improvements to be made if i ever return to this project:

1. Fixing the bugs
2. Cleaning up the code
3. Making it dynamic so that more parameters can be added
4. Making it possible to chose group-size
5. Give it a better look and styling with CSS
