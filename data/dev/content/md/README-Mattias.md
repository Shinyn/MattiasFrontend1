### This program exist as a personal learning tool for coding

It also serves the function of being the examining assignment for the frontend 1 course.  
Other than those 2 reasons it exists to sort and print out information from JSON objects.

#Technical documentation:

## **My solution**:

1. Use fetch() to access the JSON files on the local server
2. Use forEach() to go through all files and use destructuring to access the key / value pair of each individual file
3. Use a function that sorts the files into groups based on one of the key's from the JSON file
4. Use document.getelementById() to connect a button in html with js so that when you press the button

   3.2 A step by step guide to using the code you have written.
   3.3 All technical documentation should fit into README.md.
   Advanced requirements
   3.3 Describe more than one way of reusing your solution.
   3.4 Make your code as easy as possible to reuse by someone else.
   Show by example how you have taken into account who else might
   want to solve your particular problem, as well as when and why

## If you want to use the code:

- [ ] Skriv om vad man kan göra för att tweeka programmet så att man kan använda sig av alla parametrar i json filerna, samt vad man behöver lägga till för att visa dom i html'en.
